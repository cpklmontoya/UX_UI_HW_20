        <h4>Initial Testing</h4>
                    <p>I defined the user path that I would use as a baseline for my testing — and subsequently, inform the rest of the project — on what I believed is the reason most people visit the DOL website: unemployment benefits.<br><br>

                    Initial user tests revealed a confusing navigation system, roundabout instructions, and links that directed users to other sites.<br><br>
                        
                    Through these tests I was able to see what their first instincts were in moving through the website, which offered insight on how best to approach a redesign of the homepage.</p>

                      <p>Taking usability notes into account, the navigation is what needed the most overhaul. Here, I separate it into more intuitive categories — for employees, for employers, assistance, and about — that point you in the right direction and allows disregarding of information that wouldn’t be useful.</p>

                      <p>Feedback from the first iteration assured that the new navigation was easy to understand. Adjustments would need to be made to the search bar function, and correct representation of languages on the language function.<br><br>

                      After making a few changes, I felt comfortable with the navigation. The rest of the page still needed attention.</p>

                      <p>Here I tested the search icon versus the search bar, and the language at the bottom versus at the top.<br><br>

                      Nearly everyone agreed that stylistically, the search icon only was the better option. However, when taking into account accessibility, having the search bar already expanded was a much better option.<br><br>
                        
                      The language button was a very subtle change, almost too much so for an effective A/B test. After deliberation, all four of the users I tested on agreed that while it would be better up top, it would also make the header area feel much too crowded.</p>

                      <p>In this version, I’ve changed the cards of featured stories to more of an article layout. The social media icons are added, the search bar is expanded and put in a better place to flow with the rest of the navigation, and I’ve added a footer with site information. Finally, the language selector is updated with the appropriate labeling.</p>

        <h4>High Fidelity Mobile</h4>
                    <p>The initial mobile version tested much better, which is why the final remains mostly unchanged. I carried over the update of the language selector, and added a mobile version of the footer. I kept the featured stories in card format because I felt that lent itself to a better mobile experience by keeping content blocked in that way. I also moved the US DOL title further down as someone pointed out in a user test that it was cut off by the top bar of their iPhone.</p>
